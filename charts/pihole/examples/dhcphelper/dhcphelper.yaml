# DHCP Helper Deployment (Rootless)
#
# This container receives DHCP broadcasts on the host network and forwards
# them as unicast to the Pi-hole pod. This allows Pi-hole to handle DHCP
# without requiring hostNetwork on the Pi-hole pod itself.
#
# ROOTLESS OPERATION:
# This deployment runs as unprivileged user (nobody/65534) using alternate
# ports 1067/1068 instead of privileged ports 67/68.
#
# PREREQUISITE: Traffic Control (tc) rules must be configured on each node
# to redirect DHCP traffic. See README.md for details.
#
# NOTE: Adjust the service name below if your Helm release is not named "pihole"
